title: "Ruby Open Air, an unconference in Minsk Belarus"
date: 2012/06/19

---

I was recently lucky enough to be invited as a headline speaker to the
Belarusian capital Минск (Minsk) to speak at an un-conference called [Ruby
Open Air][1].

### Unconference

The format of an un-conference is inspiring, it's more BBQ-get-away than
a serious sutffy conference in a hotel conference suite; 60 km (38 miles)
from Minsk the conference was held at one of Belarus' many [Agritourism][2]
facilities; a privately owned complex covering not more than an acre or
two, featuring beautiful wooden bulidings, a covered area for giving the
presentation, utility buildings and a small island all set around a lake in
the middle of the forest.

I've never had the pleasure of giving a talk whilst bluetits tend to their
young meters from my stage, and dragonflies, toads and other wildlife buss and
hop around mere meters from you.

The conference was organized by [Altoros][3], one of Belarus' larger software
companies; they are very active in open-source, and very interested in
building good culture and inspiring young developers.

### The Country

In Belarus, it's not uncommon for an entry-level engineer in software
development to make more (*double* wouldn't be an exaggeration) than a
university professor. This tale is repeated time and time again when meeting
people; of course the reason is obvious this is money flowing in from weathier
nations in the West. In a country where a professor makes $250 per month, and
rent on a small apartment is easily $200, it doesn't leave much money for
food, or enjoying life, and many people are never able to move away from the
family home.

I was shocked, and surprised by many things I hadn't expected when arriving in
Belarus, the first and foremost is how much of the Soviet influence remains;
I'm told they have fairly recently found themselves under the rule of a
dictator who is trying to move the country back into the Soviet way of life,
flying the flags of the Soviet Union, and of Russia from every major building.

Monuments throughout the city pay hommage to the country's Soviet past, which
is both charming, intriguing, and frightening for an outsider; we grow-up
watching movies about the *evil soviets*, enemies of freedom; experiencing a
country that lives this way was very interesting; living in Germany I might
be in the most politically predictible country, the one with the strongest
economy in the English speaking world, compared with Belarus it was a shock,
one US dollar is about 8,200Br ([Belarusian Ruble][4]) (€1 ≈ 10,350Br).

*I don't know ifor how it's possible not to know what to expect but be
surprised upon arriving in a country; but it must be, because I was.*

To be clear, beyond any shadow of doubt, Belarus is one of the most
interesting, humbling and inspiring places I have been fortunate enoguh to
visit; I would recommend that as many people as possible do go there.

Obtaining a VISA is not difficult, but it is rather expensive, some €60 ($75
US) for an EU citizen, if you don't mind waiting a week or two, double the
price if an express service is required; I took the express service, as I was
short on time, and didn't want to miss the chance to visit the country, or to
disappoint my hosts. As a citizen of the European Union, it's easy to forget
that the rest of the world still struggles with Visas and border control
problems.

Although they have their own language almost everyone lives, works and
socializes in Russian; take the time to learn at least how to say *please*
(пожалуйста)and thank you (спасибо), many older (and that can mean as young as
30 years old) Belarusians don't speak very much, if any English.

Beware that all signs, place names, subway stations, hotels, and more
have their names written in the [Cyrillic script][5], be dilligent about
photographing or writing the names of the places you need to use to navigate,
because otherwise you will not even be able to read the map in the subway, or
even ask for directions by helplessly saying the name of the place you need to
go.

Even within two days, I was able to begin to identify the sounds of the
letters of the alphabet; far from being able to read; and nowhere near being
able to understand, I was at least starting to be able to guess at what
people's names might be from their name badge; a few hours practice would have
been well worth my time.

### The Conference

The other headliners, besides myself were Denis Gorin, Vladislav Gorodetsky.

The former AKA [@nomadcoder][6] has been living the couch-surfing or *nomad*
lifestyle for 5 years, working enough to earn money to keep a roof above his
head, and pay for his tickets, one of his clients encouraged the open sourcing
of a framework for binding [ExtJS][7] to a sane Ruby architecture, the project
is called [Netzke][8] and my first reaction was "ohh god, not ExtJS!", having
tried and failed to make anything useful using ExtJS before, it really appears
that Denis has solved many of the really frustrating problems; the way
Netzke works makes absolute sense. I sincerely hope that Denis' talk is made
available online, it was the only other talk of the day given in English; and
I thoroughly enjoyed watching a presentation about someone solving real world
application problems.

After two years of EuRuKo talks, where half the presentations were on
academic "improvements" to theoretical "problems", I particularly enjoyed the
pragmatism Denis demonstrated when talking about Netzke's architecture.

Unfortunately (for me) Vladislav spoke in Russian, I wish very much that I
could have understood some of his talk; I hope it becomes available online, or
that someone can refer me to anything he does (blog, twitter?) in the English
language.

There were a number of short lightening talks given in Russian, and again
unfortunately I can't say anything about them; as an Englishman in Germany
I've learned during my time here that no matter how well someone speaks a
foreign language, their native language comes more easily, and I cannot
begrudge anyone for speaking in Russian, I was the only non-Russian speaker at
the event, and I very much enjoyed listening to the sounds of the language,
and trying to decypher it's grammar and alphabet.

Throughout the day there were flip-charts stood at the back of the venue, all
attendees were encouraged to write questions for a so called *expert-panel*
discussion, it seems strange to be lined up on such a panel, but I enjoyed
answering some very hard questions about my strong opinions on REE and
Passenger *mod_rails*. The other two of the lightening talk speakers joined
the *headliners* for the expert panel discussion; and we fielded questions
on a variety of subjects; audience participation was better organized and
encouraged than at any other event I have ever attended, there must be
something about wildlife, beer, and BBQ that brings people together.

I would like to ask anyone who was involved in speaking with me that day, any
of you from the panel discussion, and anyone who missed talking to me to write
me an email, I sincerely enjoyed talking with every one of you, but as I can't
even type Cyrillic, I can't Google you, or reach out to you!

### The Entertainment

I think Altoros have raised the proverbial bar, by encouraging us to try
Archery, putting on a live band (the bass player is one of their managers!),
cooking enough BBQ шашлык [Shashlik][9] to feed us all until we were stuffed
and plying us with beer to help everyone relax!

They ran a competition to finish the joke "a proc and a lambda walk into a
bar", I got a 1/2 translation of the funniest Jack D Proc/Lambda which
apparently was quite excellent, but it lost something in translation, to the
winner, enjoy your bottle of Jack Daniels!

### The Family

Many of the people attending (mostly the organizers) had their wives and
children with them at the event; I can't over state how awesome this was, in
Europe we struggle with getting Women involved in technology. In Belarus,
admittedly because *"we wouldn't see our husbands otherwise"* the family is
around at these events. In particular the close-ties between these people is
obvious, and there's a lot of love, friendship and grace in the people of
Belarus. I thoroughly enjoyed speaking with everyone, about everything, and
I hope I have made many friends with whom I will stay in contact and I hope,
work with.

### The Politics

Lastly, I can't talk about Belarus without mentioning the politics.

I'm not qualified to speak much about politics, except to say that it's a
mafia state; every man, woman and child on the street knows it, and there is a
huge difference between the average hard working Belarusian person, and those
involved in the crime of politics. It's obvious, disgusting and frustrating; I
wouldn't be surprised to see a country in Belarus' position overthrowing it's
leaders if they do not begin to lead the country forwards; since the latest
dictator came to power the currency has apparently devalued by a factor of
three, getting a VISA has become more difficult, and they have renewed close
relations with Russia, which seems to me to be a backwards step.

### The Summary

**Go To Belarus.** If you can't go, hire their engineers. You will quite
possibly be changing someone's life. It's a nation full of driven, passionate,
friendly, curious and intelligent people; hire them to work remotely, as
freelancers or via Altoros, or a similar company. Invite them to work whilst
visiting your company in your home country; the chance to practice speaking
native English whilst on location, and the quality of work you will receive is
a win for both sides.

As a matter of neccessity there, programmers use Linux as their primary
workstation every day, people at the conference, between them had more than
a hundred patches in Rails, that's one per person… how many patches in open
source do your team in LA, or London, or Berlin have? This means they're
people bred on working with Unix, everyone uses Vi, Emacs or the shell, and
there's not much you can teach any of them about Unix that will surprise them.

Remember it was a Russian who found a fatal security flaw in Github's Rails
application! People speak about China being the home or the *next generation*
of hackers, but if that's true Eastern Europe is the home of the *current
geneartion* of hard working, intelligent engineers who are more interested in
learning, and working hard than which coffee shop makes this week's trendiest
coffee or who's written the coolest Pintrest or Instagram app.

Working with more eastern europeans might be the smartest way out of the western
engineering talent shortage and accompanying salary arms-race.

I've worked with Balarusians remotely, and spoken to a number of them in depth
during my time in Belarus, I've been nothing short of delighted. As most younger
people speak English, particularly people who spend a lot of time on the
internet - you can expect not to have any communication problems with the
engineers directly; and if you work with a company such as Altoros then you
will probabably work with the support of a native Russian speaking account
manager who lives in your counry, and speaks your language fluently too. That
is especially true of Altoros, who I'm told have something like 25-30 people
in the USA, and a handful of staff spread across western Europe and the United
Kingdom.

I have to express heart-felt thanks to Olga Lavrentieva for inviting me to
speak, and helping me get everything prepared; to  Ekaterina Kutyavina for the
help with my legal issues (Visa applications aren't much fun), to Alexey Karpik
and his wife Tatsiana for being my drivers for the weekend; and to Olga and
Sergey Sergyenko for an evenings conversation and friendhip, and a drive back to
the hotel when I missed the Bus from being too encrossed in conversation with you
to even notice that everybody had left!

My final thanks goes to Sergey Avseyev with whom I worked for a number of
months, and who had the first thought to invite me. Sergey I want thank you
for the great work we did together, and the invitation to your beautiful home
country.

*Full Disclosure**: Altoros hosted my visit to Belarus, they paid for my
flights, Visa and my hotel, their staff spent the weekend helping me get
around, and seeing the city. They didn't pay me to advocate their company, but
I absolutely do so. I don't work for Altoros, but I think I'd really enjoy
working with them, they already sponsor some engineers to work on open source,
and I hope to come to an arrangement with them to continue my open source work
in the interests of the Ruby community.
