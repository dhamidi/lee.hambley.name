        :markdown
          Freiminuten (literally *free minutes*) is a bonus program connected
          to the TradeDoubler and Affili.net networks, earning revenue by
          referring users to partner stores, and earning a small commission.

          This commission is then given to their users as mobile phone credit.
          Freiminuten also provides back-end services to mobile network operators
          for crediting accounts via real-time APIs.

        %h4 Watched.it
        :markdown
          This project I started in 2009, I'm working to build a product which works
          across all platforms to eliminate the differences in scheduling, season
          breaks, spoilers and everything else that makes watching TV suck.

          Watched.it plugs into many common media players to automatically scrobble
          (*track*, or *record*) which episodes, of which shows are watched, and sends
          intelligent notifications about follow-ups, or othere interesting content.

          Desktop client applications make it easy to see, at a glance which episodes
          you have already seen. With simple integrations with iTunes and Amaozon VOD
          it makes it a simple one-click process to buy the newest episodes when they become
          available.

    :markdown
      Speach Media's main project is Freiminuten.de; Acting as CTO, I ensure that we
      make the correct technical decisions, and keep the platform moving in the right direction.
      I am also their only developer. (*that part isn't so great!*)

      I took over the project after the initial 8 week inception phase, after 12 months of
      feature development and paying-back of *technical debt* we were able to focus on a variety
      of improvements to the backend APIs which enable the platform to be autonomous, and run with
      almost no human interaction.

      The stack is Ruby on Rails, Resque, Elastic Search, Sinatra, [Middleman], SASS and HAML.
      Running on top of a Chef managed [Linode] cluster running Ubuntu.

    Watched.it Limited

    :markdown
      I founded [Watched.it] in 2009 and have been working slowly but steadily on it since then.

      Acting as founder, developer, product owner, accountant, marketeer, customer, debugger,
      QA and designer has been tougher than I ever imagined it would be.

      [Watched.it] works a lot like [last.fm], [scrobbling] the TV Shows that people watch on
      their computers, or allowing them to manually scrobble using the web application, or via
      their smartphone.

      [Watched.it] provides an at-a-glance overview of which content is available, and which
      contend has already been watched, allowing people to forget about ever-changing TV
      schedules, release delays, mid-season breaks, and more.

      The side-effect of providing a useful service to TV fans, is a a valuable insight into
      realtime viewing patterns across all mediums, especially those often overlooked by cable
      rating companies.

      The stack is Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Resque, [C], [ZeroMQ], [Backbone.js]. Running in
      a [Linode] supported by [CloudFront] managed with Chef and Capistrano.

      **Watched.it is actively seeking investment, mentors and assistance to make my dream
      become a reality, if you are interested in working with me, investing and believing in me,
      and helping to make my project enter the mainstream, please [contact me].**
